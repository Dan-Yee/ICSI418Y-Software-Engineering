# ICSI 418Y - Software Engineering - Team 1 (Grade Calculator Website)
Copy of the repository for the team project in Spring 2022-ICSI 418Y-Software Engineering. All original git commits were done on a separate, private, GitLab instance.

## Personal Contribution
I designed and implemented the functions for the dynamic input fields for both Basic.html and Advanced.html. While designing the functionality of the input fields,
I also designed and implemented the "Calculate" function for both versions of the calculator. I also added the "Instructions" and "Grade Summary" sections to each respective page.
